# Personal Websites

I am selling personal websites for 5 CS:GO Keys, about $15, with this you will get a free .tk domain, like the ones below, for a full year. You will also have cloudflare protection, so your site will not go down to DDOS/DOS attacks. If you want to buy a .net, .com, or any other domain. I can do that as well, but If you have not purchased one of these domains yet, it will cost extra money.

These sites are hand made to order, so each site looks different from one another, to the customer specifications.

Examples of my sites can be found here: https://Chase88.tk , https://Shortykid.tk , https://Sethibuns.tk
